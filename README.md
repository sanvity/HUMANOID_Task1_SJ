Heyyy!
Let's play CONNECT4.

Rules are simple...
it's a two player game. Take turns to play your piece in the grid, whichever player is successful to make a pattern of 4 pieces say, horizontally, vertically or even diagonally WINSS!

Ok too simple, let's mix it up a bit...

@CONNECT4_SUPREME 
Outsmart your opponent with yet another winning pattern, a quadra-diamond...like you xD

The game though could get tricky, so make sure to use your best judgement.

LEZZGOO...
